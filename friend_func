FRIEND FUNCTION:It is a non-memeber function of a class,which can access private and protected members of that class.
  .Declaration of friend function should only within class and implementation  should be outside of the class.


Why we need friend function?
  .when class private data needs to accessed directly without using object of that class.



 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Rec{
   int l;
    int b;
    public:
    Rec(int l,int b)
    {
        this->l=l;
        this->b=b;
    }
    friend void  area_of_rec(Rec);//we can pass argument as class name
};
void area_of_rec(Rec o)
{
    cout<<"Area is:"<<(o.l*o.b)<<endl;
}
int main ()
{
    Rec obj(2,3);
    area_of_rec(obj);
    
  
  return 0;
}
